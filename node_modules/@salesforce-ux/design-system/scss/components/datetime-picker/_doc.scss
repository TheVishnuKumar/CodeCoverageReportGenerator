/**
 * #### Implementation Notes and Requirements
 *
 * The datetime picker has the following markup requirements:
 *
 * **Desktop**
 * - Add `.slds-is-open` to the element with `.slds-dropdown-trigger` to invoke the dropdown that contains the datepicker and the list of time options.
 * - On the timepicker, the `.slds-has-focus` modifier class is required on the `.slds-listbox__option` element that has focus.
 * - On the timpicker, the `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `.slds-listbox__option` element that has been selected.
 * - On the datepicker, the `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `td` element that has the selected day.
 * - On the datepicker, the `.slds-is-today` modifier class is required on the `td` element that is the current day.
 *
 * **Mobile**
 * - When on mobile, we want to leverage the native datetime picker by changing the `input` type from `text` to `datetime-local`
 * - The `input type="datetime-local"` will create an input field allowing a date and time to be easily entered â€” this includes year, month, day, hours, and minutes.
 * - When switching `input type="text"` to `input type="datetime-local"` for mobile, we need to remove the ARIA attributes. The native rendering doesn't require these.
 *   - On the element with the class `slds-combobox`, please remove `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-haspopup.
 *   - On the `input` that we just added `type="datetime-local"` to, please remove `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, and `role="textbox"`.
 *
 * @summary A datetime picker is used to select a day and a time.
 *
 * @base
 * @name datetime-picker
 * @selector .slds-datetime-picker
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category experience
 * @type data-entry
 * @role grid, combobox
