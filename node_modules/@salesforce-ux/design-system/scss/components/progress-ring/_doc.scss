/**
 * The Progress Ring component renders a svg-based progress ring.
 *
 * Content (typically iconography) can be rendered inside the progress ring. For the current supported size of this progress ring, xxs sized icons should be used.
 *
 * ### Implementation Guidelines
 *
 * #### Defining Progress Ring Completeness
 *
 * The 'completeness' of the Progress Ring is indicated by the circular shape (pie slice), which is a svg shape of an arc.
 *
 * The path declaration looks complex, but is actually pretty straightforward, with just a few parts that need customization.
 *
 * The breakdown of the progress ring's `d` attribute can be broken down like so:
 * d="M 1 0 A 1 1 0 {isLong} 1 {arcX} {arcY} L 0 0"
 *
 * - isLong: a binary flag if the arc should 'take the long path' (used for > 50% fill)
 * - arcX: the arc's x position, formulated by Math.cos(2 * Math.PI * fillPercent)
 * - arcY: the arc's y position, formulated by Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * fillPercent)
 *
 * These calculations work in accordance with the defined svg viewBox, which goes from -1 to 1, on both x and y axis.
 *
 * #### Progress Ring Content
 *
 * The Progress Ring is currently designed to display any icon from our icon set.
 *
 * ### Accessibility Guidelines
 *
 * `.slds-progress-ring__progress` is the visual indicator of progress and needs proper aria roles and settings:
 * - `role` : `progressbar`
 * - `aria-valuemin` : `0` // the smallest valid value
 * - `aria-valuemax` : `100` // the largest valid value
 * - `aria-valuenow` : `{fill}` // the current fill value
 *
 * Proper accessibility guidelines should be followed on any icons used within this Progress Ring component.
 *
 * @summary Customizable and configurable progress ring. Will display progress in a circular progress bar factor, and is capable of displaying iconography inside of the ring structure.
 *
 * @base
 * @name progress-ring
 * @selector .slds-progress-ring
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category base
 * @layout responsive
