/**
 * #### Implementation Notes and Requirements
 *
 * The datepicker has the following markup requirements:
 *
 * **Desktop**
 * - Add `.slds-is-open` to the element with `.slds-dropdown-trigger` to invoke the dropdown that contains the datepicker.
 * - The `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `td` element that has the selected day.
 * - The `.slds-is-today` modifier class is required on the `td` element that is the current day.
 * - The `.slds-has-multi-selection` modifier class is required on the `tr` element that contains multiple days selected in the **same** week.
 * - The `.slds-has-multi-row-selection` modifier class is required on any `tr` element that contains multiple days selected in the **multiple** weeks.
 * - The `.slds-is-selected-multi` modifier class is required on the `td` element that contains a selected day within a range.
 *
 * **Mobile**
 * - When on mobile, we want to leverage the native date picker by changing the `input` type from `text` to `date`
 * - The `input type="date"` will create an input field allowing a date and time to be easily entered â€” this includes year, month, day.
 * - When switching `input type="text"` to `input type="date"` for mobile, we need to remove the ARIA attributes. The native rendering doesn't require these.
 *   - On the element with the class `slds-combobox`, please remove `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-haspopup`.
 *   - On the `input` that we just added `type="date"` to, please remove `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, and `role="textbox"`.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * **Expected Markup**
 *
 * ##### Dialog
 *
 * - Should act as a focus trap so the user only cycles through the datepicker `dialog` when the datepicker is open
 *
 * ##### Grid
 *
 * - Table must be labelled with `role="grid"` and be appropriately labelled with `aria-labelledby`
 * - Use `aria-multiselectable="true"` to allow for selection of multiple days
 * - Should act as a single focus stop
 *
 * ##### Gridcell
 *
 * - All dates should have `role="gridcell"` and `aria-selected="false"` on the `gridcell` by default
 * - If a date is selected, `aria-selected` should be set to `true` on the corresponding `gridcell`
 * - `aria-current` is used to indicate which day is today and should be set to `aria-current="date"`
 *
 * **Opening the Datepicker**
 *
 * - Mouse user: open the datepicker when a mouse user clicks on the input
 * - Keyboard user: only open the datepicker when a keyboard user presses `enter` or `space` on the datepicker button
 *   - Do not open the datepicker when user focus is on the input
 *
 * **Expected Keyboard Interactions**
 *
 * - When the datepicker opens, place user focus on either the currently selected date in the grid or if no date is selected the current day
 * - `left` and `right` arrow keys to navigate row
 * - `up` and `down` arrow keys to navigate between weeks on the same day
 * - `home` and `end` keys to jump to beginning or end of current row
 * - `pagedown` and `pageup` to naviate between months
 * - `alt + pagedown` and `alt + pageup` to navigate between years
 * - `enter` to select date and close datepicker
 * - `esc` to close datepicker without choosing a date
 *
 * @summary A datepicker is a text input to capture a date. You can select a single date, date range or date and time.
