/**
 * At a high-level, the buttons in RTE are organized into four groupings:
 * “format text”, “format body”, “insert content”, and “clear formatting”.
 *
 * The “clear formatting” button always stays at the end of the buttons set,
 * regardless of which rich text editor variant is used. It should always stand by itself.
 *
 * On smaller screen sizes, the select dropdowns for Font and Size in the toolbar can overlap
 * outside of the container. To adjust the widths of the dropdowns, apply the class
 * `slds-region_narrow` to the outermost `div` of the rich text editor.
 *
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Ensure that there is a single tab key stop for the button groups in the
 * toolbar, and that left and right arrows are used to navigate through each button.
 *
 * @summary The Rich Text Editor is a textarea with added capabilities for use in various publishers.
 *
 * @base
 * @name rich-text-editor
 * @selector .slds-rich-text-editor
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category feature
