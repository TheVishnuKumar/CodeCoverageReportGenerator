/**
 *
 * @summary Navigation represents a list of links that either take the user to another page or parts of the page the user is in.
 *
 *
 * **Radio Group Variant**
 *
 * The radio group variant should be used when your vertical navigation acts as a selection or filter on content, like within a modal. If the vertical navigation takes the user to another page or part of a page, use the standard List version. If your content changes entirely whenever options in the navigation are selected, instead of filtering one master list, then use the [Vertical Tabs](/components/vertical-tabs) component.
